## 🔥 What is Linux?

Linux is an **open-source operating system (OS)** that powers everything from **smartphones to supercomputers**. It is known for its **stability, security, and flexibility**, making it the preferred choice for **developers, system administrators, and enterprises** worldwide.

## 🚀 Why is Linux Better Than Other OS?

✅ **Open-Source & Free** – No licensing costs! ✅ **Security & Stability** – Less prone to viruses and crashes. ✅ **Lightweight & Efficient** – Runs on low-spec hardware. ✅ **Customization** – Modify the system as per your needs. ✅ **Developer & Server Friendly** – Preferred for programming and web hosting. ✅ **Community Support** – Massive online help from developers worldwide.

## 🏗️ Linux Architecture

Linux follows a **modular architecture** consisting of **four main components**:

1. **User** – The person interacting with the system via a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
    
2. **Shell** – Acts as an intermediary between the user and the system, interpreting user commands and passing them to the kernel.
    
3. **Kernel** – The core of the Linux OS that manages hardware resources, handles system calls, and executes commands.
    
4. **Hardware** – The physical components such as the CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices.

    📌 **Flow of Interaction:**
    
    1. **User Inputs Command** – The user types a command into the terminal or uses a GUI.
        
    2. **Shell Interprets the Command** – The shell processes the command and translates it into system calls.
        
    3. **Kernel Handles System Calls** – The kernel executes system calls and interacts with hardware components to perform requested operations.
        
    4. **Hardware Executes the Task** – The requested operation (like reading a file, running a program, or accessing memory) is performed, and the result is sent back to the user via the shell.
        
    
    ## 🗂️ Linux File System Hierarchy (FHS)
    
    Linux organizes files in a **single-rooted, inverted tree structure** where **everything is a file**. The **root directory (**`/`**)** is at the top.
    
    ### 🔹 Important Directories Explained:
    
    In Linux, **everything is a file**, including hardware devices and system configurations. The **root (**`/`**) user** is the **superuser**with full control over the system, capable of modifying any file or executing any command. Regular users have restricted access and may get a **'Permission Denied'** error when attempting actions that require administrative privileges.
    
    To perform such actions, regular users can use:
    
    * `sudo` **(Superuser Do)** – Grants temporary superuser access.
        
    * `su` **(Switch User)** – Switches to the root user for full control.

    Understanding the **Linux file system hierarchy** is crucial for managing files and permissions effectively.
    
    * `/` **(Root Directory)** – The top-level directory containing all system files. The root user has full control, while normal users have restricted access.
        
    * `/root` **(Root User's Home)** – The personal home directory of the **superuser** (root), separate from regular users.
        
    * `/bin` **(User Binaries)** – Stores essential system commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mkdir`, accessible by all users.
        
    * `/sbin` **(System Binaries)** – Contains administrative commands like `fdisk`, `iptables`, and `ifconfig`, mostly used by the root user.
        
    * `/dev` **(Device Files)** – Represents **hardware devices** as files, such as `tty` (terminal), `usb` (USB devices), and storage disks.
        
    * `/var` **(Variable Files)** – Stores logs, emails, and databases, including:
        
        * `/var/log` – System logs.
            
        * `/var/mail` – User emails.
            
        * `/var/lib` – Databases and packages.
            
    * `/mnt` **(Mount Directory)** – Temporary mount point for external devices like additional drives.
        
    * `/media` **(Removable Media)** – Mount point for USBs, DVDs, and external storage devices.
        
    * `/usr` **(User Applications)** – Houses installed applications and system-wide libraries.
        
    * `/etc` **(Configuration Files)** – Stores essential system and application configuration files.
        
    * `/boot` **(Boot Loader Files)** – Contains Linux **kernel** and boot loader (GRUB) files required to start the OS.
        
    * `/opt` **(Optional Software)** – Directory for third-party software installations.
        
    * `/home` **(User Directories)** – Home directories for all users (`/home/user1`, `/home/user2`), storing personal files.
        
    * `/tmp` **(Temporary Files)** – Stores temporary files created by system and users, cleared on reboot.
