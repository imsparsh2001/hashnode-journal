Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform**. It manages containerized applications across clusters of machines, handling deployment, scaling, networking, and updates. Without Kubernetes, running containers at scale quickly becomes chaoticâ€”K8s brings automation and reliability.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Why Learn Kubernetes Architecture?

When running containers in production, challenges arise:

* Containers crash and must restart automatically.
    
* Applications need to scale up/down based on demand.
    
* Network traffic must be balanced between multiple replicas.
    
* Updates should happen without downtime.
    

Kubernetes addresses these through its architecture. Understanding the components will help you design, deploy, and debug systems effectively.

## ðŸ§  Control Plane (Cluster Brain)

The **Control Plane** is the decision-maker in Kubernetes. It manages the cluster and ensures that the systemâ€™s **desired state** (what you declare in YAML) matches the **actual state** (whatâ€™s running).

### 1\. **API Server** (`kube-apiserver`)

* Acts as the **front door** of the cluster.
    
* All commands (`kubectl`, dashboards, controllers, kubelets) go through it.
    
* Responsibilities:
    
    * **Authentication & Authorization** â†’ validates user or component access.
        
    * **Validation** â†’ checks YAML/JSON manifests for correctness.
        
    * **Admission Control** â†’ enforces policies (quotas, security, limits).
        
    * **Persistence** â†’ forwards cluster data to etcd.
        
* The API Server exposes the entire Kubernetes functionality as a REST API.
    

### 2\. **etcd**

* A **distributed key-value store** that acts as the clusterâ€™s database.
    
* Stores all persistent cluster state:
    
    * Nodes in the cluster
        
    * Running pods
        
    * ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services
        
    * Desired vs actual workloads
        
* Highly available and fault-tolerant.
    
* Without etcd, Kubernetes would have no memory of what should exist.
    

### 3\. **Scheduler** (`kube-scheduler`)

* Watches for **unscheduled pods** (pods defined but not assigned to a node).
    
* Makes scheduling decisions based on:
    
    * Node resources (CPU, memory).
        
    * Node selectors and affinity/anti-affinity rules.
        
    * Taints and tolerations.
        
    * Pod priority and policies.
        
* The Scheduler doesnâ€™t run containers itself; it only updates the API Server with pod â†’ node assignments.
    

### 4\. **Controller Manager** (`kube-controller-manager`)

* Runs multiple controllers, each responsible for specific functions.
    
* A **controller** is a control loop that continuously checks the actual state against the desired state and takes corrective action.
    
* Examples:
    
    * **Node Controller** â†’ monitors node health, reacts if a node goes down.
        
    * **ReplicaSet Controller** â†’ ensures the correct number of pod replicas.
        
    * **Deployment Controller** â†’ manages rolling updates and rollbacks.
        
    * **Endpoint Controller** â†’ updates service endpoints as pods come and go.
        
* Controllers make Kubernetes **self-healing**.
    

### 5\. **Cloud Controller Manager** (optional)

* Runs only in cloud environments.
    
* Interfaces with cloud provider APIs (AWS, GCP, Azure).
    
* Handles tasks like:
    
    * Provisioning cloud load balancers.
        
    * Attaching persistent storage.
        
    * Managing cloud-based node lifecycle.

## ðŸ’ª Worker Nodes (Cluster Muscles)

Worker nodes are where your applications (Pods) actually run. Each worker node has the components required to execute workloads assigned by the Control Plane.

### 1\. **Kubelet**

* An agent that runs on every worker node.
    
* Communicates with the API Server.
    
* Receives PodSpecs (instructions) â†’ starts pods via the container runtime.
    
* Continuously monitors running pods and reports status back to the Control Plane.
    
* Restarts failed containers to maintain desired state.
    

### 2\. **Container Runtime**

* The software responsible for actually running containers.
    
* Kubernetes supports multiple runtimes via the CRI (Container Runtime Interface).
    
* Common runtimes:
    
    * `containerd` (default in most distros)
        
    * `CRI-O`
        
    * Docker (deprecated as a runtime, but still widely known)
        
* Pulls images from registries and executes containers inside pods.
    

### 3\. **Kube-Proxy**

* Manages networking and load balancing.
    
* Implements Kubernetes **Service abstraction**:
    
    * Ensures pods within a Service can be reached consistently even if pod IPs change.
        
    * Distributes traffic between multiple pods.
        
* Works by configuring iptables or IPVS rules.

## ðŸ”„ End-to-End Flow: How Kubernetes Works

Letâ€™s trace what happens when you deploy an app:

1. **Developer applies a YAML file** (e.g., `kubectl apply -f app.yaml`).
    
2. **API Server** validates the request and stores the desired state in etcd.
    
3. **Controller Manager** detects the gap (desired pods vs. running pods) and requests pod creation.
    
4. **Scheduler** assigns the pods to suitable worker nodes.
    
5. **Kubelet** on those worker nodes picks up the PodSpec and instructs the container runtime to pull the image and start the container(s).
    
6. **Kube-Proxy** configures networking so traffic can reach the pods through Services.
    
7. **Feedback Loop**: Controllers continuously monitor actual vs desired state. If a pod fails, Kubernetes automatically replaces it (self-healing).

## âœ… Key Takeaways

* **Control Plane = Brain** â†’ makes decisions and stores cluster state.
    
* **Worker Nodes = Muscles** â†’ execute workloads and run containers.
    
* **Controllers = Autopilot** â†’ keep actual state aligned with desired state.
    
* **etcd = Memory** â†’ stores everything persistently.
    

Kubernetes is designed around separation of responsibilities. By understanding its architecture, you gain the ability to deploy, troubleshoot, and scale modern applications with confidence.
